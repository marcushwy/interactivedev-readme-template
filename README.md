# My Portfolio 

I have created a basic, static website showcasing my portfolio and my work. I have also included my education history inside the website, as well as my job experience and some other fun stuff.
 
## Design Process
 
My design process is to create a simplistic website showcasing my portfolio, and is focused for people that might want to hire/scout for employees .

In particular, as a student, I would like to learn more about the depths of IT and hopefully pursue a career in the same field in the future.



## Features
functional navigation bar, contact form (for submitting feedback)


### Features Left to Implement
photo album, dropdown menu, more aesthetically appealing shapes and designs

## Technologies Used
HTML and CSS with personal laptop 

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

The background of the website resizes automatically based on the deviced used.
